# Weather-reporting-application
Purpose of the project:
I did the simple,interactive weather reporting application.The purpose is 
to get accurate results (e.g city temperature,date&time,type of weather) by 
providing only city name.

Tools & Technology:
Here, I used python Flask web framework,Web scraping by beautifulsoup,
HTML,& CSS.

Description of project:
it is easy to use, Here we have only one interactive interface where we insert
the city name, which we want to know the weather, after submiting city it gives the
current weather report of this city.
